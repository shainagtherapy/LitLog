## Visit the [LitLog app here](https://litlog-1c3282997a3b.herokuapp.com/)!

Sign up to create a personal library of the trendiest books you've read. Search for books, audiobooks, and podcasts about books with integrated APIs from Spotify and Google Books to save to your shelf for tracking, adding notes, or saving for later.

Update your current reads or listens once you've finished with notes and a personal reviews. Each entry log allows full CRUD functions to create, view, update or delete as needed.

**Background**: This project was inspired by my own desire to organize a collaborative library of audio, print, and ebooks directly connected with my favorite apps, but all in once place!

Stretch Goals:
* make all forms into modals
* a 'bookmarks' page to save URL links of social media posts or book links (similar to a wishlist) with full CRUD
* allow public viewing to see other users libraries
* include what a user is 'currently reading' on their profile page
* link each log entry to its source (google link or spotify track)
```
